## Introduction

Mathematical reasoning often requires integrating different types of information. This project focuses on how visual elements can improve this integration. By applying simple visual perturbations, we aim to boost the performance of models in multimodal math reasoning tasks. 

Our research shows that even minor changes in visual input can lead to significant improvements in reasoning accuracy. This repository contains the code, data, and results from our experiments.

## Key Concepts

### Multimodal Learning

Multimodal learning involves combining different types of data, such as text and images. This approach can lead to better understanding and improved results in various tasks, including math reasoning.

### Visual Perturbations

Visual perturbations refer to small changes in visual input that can affect how information is processed. In our study, we explore how these perturbations can enhance reasoning abilities.

### Math Reasoning

Math reasoning is the ability to solve problems and make decisions based on mathematical concepts. It is crucial in many fields, from education to data science.

## Installation

To get started with Vision Matters, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XxabueloxX/Vision-Matters.git
   cd Vision-Matters
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Data**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/XxabueloxX/Vision-Matters/releases) section to download the dataset. Unzip it and place it in the `data/` folder.

4. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided scripts to run experiments. The main functionalities include:
